#### JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or `JIT compiled programming language` with `first-class functions`. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, `many non-browser environments` also use it, such as `node.js` and Apache `CouchDB`. JS is a `prototype-based`, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
